The main aim of developing Reservation, system is to provide all information that is required by the
users. User friendliness is a must that is the user must get the details without complicated searching
procedures. Other important requirements of software are data security, Extensibility and maintainability.
All these features are included in this web application.
The project greatly helped in understanding the various phases in website development and
exposure to a new developer platform PHP and CSS.

A hotel reservation system works by processing secure online reservations made through a hotel’s website.

The data is then passed onto a backend system which can be accessed by hotels to manage bookings. Other features may come with it – for example, the automation of reservation confirmation emails.

Small hotel managers and owners recognize that technology is key to growing their business and increasing their bookings overtime.

To sell rooms to capacity and to appeal to a global audience, a hotel reservation system is required.

However, it can be intimidating to select a system, particularly when so many are designed for large hotel operations and chains.
